# G-FTL-Optimization
Optimizing the FTL's FedProx Algorithm to provide better convergence at 5% level of significance consideration.


Run the main file to get the total idea of the experimentation 
The file used for this analysis is a Height and Weight indexing done on a certain population 
and is derived from a kaggle dataset.

The "normal.py" provides and contains modules that provides insight regarding the normal technique for estimating
a certain estimation model
The "optimize.py" provides and contains modules that provides the former for methodology. 
Though not the complete implementation using a proper FedProx algorithm it showcases the accuracy provided by the 
proposed model for generic predication and statistical parameters like mean and linear regression line.
